      <h2>Art</h2>
	 <p> I love to create art, whether it's on a laptop, an ipad or by hand. I enjoy creating through different mediums. I will be (trying) to link some of my art to this webpage in order for you to see them. One of the things I enjoy most is being able to execute the ideas that I have in my head into something that everyone else can admire.  </p>
