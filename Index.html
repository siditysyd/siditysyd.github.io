	 <p> I love to create art, whether it's on a laptop, an ipad or by hand. I enjoy creating through different mediums.

      <h2>Plants</h2>
      <p>I am a plant mom. I have over 30 different types of plants. Most of them are houseplants as I don't like bugs. I find joy in being able to grow plants from small seeds into large beautiful plants. They also make my house look amazing and some of the plants help to purify the air. </p>
